# Hi :wave:
I am an 18-year-old developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions and crafting seamless user experiences. Skilled in Java, Python, HTML, and the Electron Framework, I specialize in building dynamic web and desktop applications that combine functionality with design.

With a strong drive for learning and problem-solving, I embrace challenges and enjoy bringing creative ideas to life through technology. From back-end systems to interactive front-end designs, I approach every project with enthusiasm and dedication to producing clean, scalable code.
